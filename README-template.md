## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

After reading the style guide and creating the React app, I spent the majority of the time making sure all the functional elements worked before starting any styling.  For this project, at least 80% of the logic is driven by the maintenance of the 'filters' used to select the jobs to display.  After that, I started styling the components which lead to a couple iterations of code revisions to add omissions and fix bugs.  And once I thought the code was working as intended, I spent some time refactoring the code, removing console logs, and adding comments.

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styling React Components
- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

This was an great excercise in React and styled-components and I will continue to focus on projects like to keep get more experience in both of these... along with flexbox, JavaScript, and CSS.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - An invaluable resource that I use daily.
- [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is a greate resource on flexbox!  
- [React Constants](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/css-variables-for-react-devs/) - This article helped to remind me to use a 'constants' file and folder for code like CSS variables.
- [styled-component documentation](https://styled-components.com/) - This was my first solo adventure with styled-components and their documentation was very helpful.
- [stack-overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31000885/align-an-element-to-bottom-with-flexbox) - The recommendation to use 'flex-grow: 1;' was exactly what I needed to position the last flexbox element to the right side of the container.
- [stack-overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34582405/react-wont-load-local-images) - The recommendation to "Keep all your images(or any assets like videos, fonts) in the public folder as shown below." solved my problem with loading images dynamically with React.
